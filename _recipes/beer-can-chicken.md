# What you need
* 1 whole free-range chicken
* Olive oil
* 1 can of beer
* 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce
* 1 fresh red chilli , deseeded
* 1 bunch of spring onions , trimmed
* ½ a bunch of fresh coriander

## Dry rub

* 1 heaped tablespoon smoked paprika
* 1 heaped teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 heaped tablespoon fennel seeds
* 1 heaped tablespoon coriander seeds
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1-2 dried red chillies
* 1 heaped teaspoon sea salt
* 1 heaped tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 heaped tablespoon soft dark brown sugar

# How it's done

Remove the chicken from the fridge and leave aside to come up to room temperature and
Preheat the oven to 200ºC.

Bash the rub ingredients to a fine powder in a large pestle and mortar (or grind in a spice grinder), then drizzle the chicken with olive oil. Sprinkle over the rub and use your hands to massage the rub into the chicken.

Crack open the beer and drink around 1/2 of it, then carefully lower the chicken cavity onto the can so it looks like it’s sitting up. Position the chicken so it’s upright on a roasting tray, then place in the oven and cook for around 1 hour 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. To check it’s done, insert a knife into the thickest part of the thigh – the juices should run clear.

Brush the chicken all over with the barbecue sauce, then return to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until dark and sticky.

Meanwhile, finely slice the chilli and spring onions and pick the coriander leaves. Once ready, carefully remove and discard the can, then carve up the bird, scatter over the chilli, spring onions and coriander leaves, then serve.
