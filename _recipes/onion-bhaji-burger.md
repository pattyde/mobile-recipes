## How it's done

Put all the burger ingredients in a bowl and stir until you have a batter (add more water if you think it needs it)

Make a patties out of the batter & deep fry them until they’re golden & crispy (you could probably shallow fry them if you’d prefer, maybe even bake them!)

Put all the guacamole ingredients in a bowl & mash with a fork
