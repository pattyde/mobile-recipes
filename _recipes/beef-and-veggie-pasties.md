# How it's done

Preheat oven to 200 C

Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan and cook beef over high heat for 5 minutes. Remove beef from pan and discard excess fat.

Add onion, garlic and chilli. Cook for 5 minutes

Add carrots and potatoes and cook an additional 3 minutes, stirring often

Return beef to pan along with peas, tomato and spinach, cooking until spinach wilts.

Remove from heat. Stir through parsley and cheese, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Let cool for 10 minutes.

Divide mixture evenly into the centres of the four pastry rounds. Brush edges of pastry with egg, fold pastry in half and crimp edges together to seal

Place pasties on a tray lined with baking paper. Poke holes in pastry to allow steam to escape. Brush remaining egg over pasties and sprinkle parmesan.

Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown

Serve with tomato sauce. Yum.
