## What you need
* 90 ml extra virgin olive oil + 2 tbsp
* 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped
* 1 small shallot, finely chopped
* 2 lemons
* 500g skinless salmon fillets

## How it's done

Heat barbecue to medium high heat.

Mix olive oil with dill, shallot and zest of one lemon. Coat salmon with some of the dill oil. Season with sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper.

Barbecue the salmon for 2 Â½-4 minutes each side depending on thickness, or until char marks form and the salmon still has a rosy centre.

Meanwhile, brush bread slices with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Barbecue until char marks form.

Coat zucchini with remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Barbecue for 2 minutes each side or until char marks form.

Roughly break up salmon and arrange chunks of salmon on the bread and zucchini.

Whisk juice of 2 lemons into the remaining dill oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper (and more lemon juice if necessary).

Drizzle the dill/lemon sauce over the bruschetta and serve.
