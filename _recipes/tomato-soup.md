## What you need

* Tomatoes
* Onion
* Garlic

<!-- break -->

## How it's done

Put:

* Tomatoes (whole)
* Onion (depending on size quartered with skin on)
* Garlic (whole)

In a roasting pan and cook in the oven until soft.

I removed the onion skins, and squeeze the pulp of the garlic out, and the tomatoes skin just peels off easily (I leave seeds in)

Toss everything into a sauce pan over a low heat and blitz it with a stick mixer. Doesn’t usually need stock. Then I just season it.

Depends on how we feel - might be salt and pepper, paprika, basil if you like.

I’ve even tossed a chilli in the roast pan as well.
