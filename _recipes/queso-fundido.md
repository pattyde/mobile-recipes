## How it's done

Heat the oil in an cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until lightly browned. Drain off most of the liquid.

Add the tomato, onion, and jalapeño and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion begins to soften and brown (about 7 minutes).

Add the tequila and reduce to a glaze.

Add evaporated milk

Slowly stir in cheese until just melted, then stir in the coriander. Serve immediately in the pan with chips for dipping.
