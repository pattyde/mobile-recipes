## How it's done

### Crust

Crush biscuits to fine crumbs, either in a food processor, or by breaking them into a ziplock bag and crushing with a rolling pin. Either way, you'll probably need to do this in 3 or 4 batches.

Mix in melted butter and stir until well combined.

Press the crumb mixture firmly into the bottom and sides of a 23cm springform pan, using either a small glass or the back of a spoon.

Place in the fridge while you prepare the next layer.

### Filling

Mix all ingredients together until smooth and well blended. Pour into crumb crust and bake at 180 degrees Celsius for 20-25 minutes. Remove from oven, let stand 15 minutes while you prepare the topping.

Turn oven up to 230 degrees.

### Top

Stir all ingredients well, until sugar is dissolved. Spoon over filling. Sprinkle with nutmeg if desired.

Bake at 230 degrees for 10-15 minutes. Let cool at room temperature, then chill overnight.
