* 1 cup milk
* Vegetable Oil

<!-- break -->

## How it's done

Mix flour, egg and 1/2 cup of milk with wooden spoon, it should be thick so you can get the lumps out, but everything is muddy in consistency.

Keep adding and stirring in milk until runny, like cream.

Put a vegetable oil in a pan, enough to just thinly coat the pan, mix it around, keep it hot

Pour in about a third of a cup (maybe more) and tip pan to coat bottom. About a dinner plate sized pan is a good size.
