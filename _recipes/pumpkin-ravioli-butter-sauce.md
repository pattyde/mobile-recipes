## How it's done

Preheat oven to 180C.

### Macadamia Crumb

Place macadamias in a small frying pan over low heat. Stir occasionally until golden then remove from heat.

Transfer toasted macadamias to a food processor with breadcrumbs and blitz to a coarse crumb

Place crumb mix back into the frypan over medium heat and fry until golden.

Remove from heat and top with lemon zest, set aside.

### Prosciutto Butter Sauce

Melt butter in a frypan over medium heat. Add prosciutto and fry, stirring occasionally until slightly caramelised but not crisp.

Add sage leaves and cook until leaves are crisp.

Serve ravioli topped with sauce

### Ravioli

Spread diced pumpkin and garlic onto a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil. Roast until caramelised, about 20 minutes.

Remove from oven and transfer to a bowl. Add remaining ingredients and mash together with a fork until smooth and creamy. Season to taste

Place sheets of pasta dough on a floured surface. Cut approximately in half. If one 'half' ends up smaller, use that as the base for the ravioli.

Place balls of 2-3 teaspoons of pumpkin mix onto base sheet of pasta at approx 7 cm intervals along sheet.

Brush pasta around filling balls with water. Place second half sheet over the top and press around the filling to seal.

Cut into approx 7cm rounds with a cookie cutter.

Cook for 3 minutes in boiling water

Serve pasta topped with sauce, and sprinkled generously with crumb
