## How it's done

Rub spice mix over ribs, put in baking dish and cover with foil. Cook for 2-3 hours on low heat (around 110).

Meanwhile, wrap the thyme in the bacon and fry it in oil for a bit until it starts rendering the fat out.

Add onion and garlic and fry until softened.

Add vinegar and reduce by half

Add all remaining ingredients and adjust flavouring to suit. Be careful once youâ€™ve added the ketchup it will bubble big thick hot sauce bubbles at you!

Take them out uncover and crank up the oven to 220. Slather in sauce and put back in oven to get all sticky and delicious. Recoat after 5-10 mins around 2-3 times.

Pick out thyme/bacon and serve

Eat the bacon, because who wastes bacon?
