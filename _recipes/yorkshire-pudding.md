## How it's done

Preheat the oven to 220℃

Pour 2 teaspoons of oil into each hole of a 12-hole muffin tin. Put in the oven.

Mix salt with flour then add to the beaten eggs bowl 2 spoonfuls at a time

Add 2 tablespoons of the milk with the final batch of flour. Whisk until smooth and thick.

Slowly pour the rest of the milk into the mixture, just a little at a time at first, beating well as you go, to make a smooth batter. Transfer the batter to a jug.

Carefully remove muffin tins from the oven and pour in the batter to half-fill each hole.

Bake for 15-20 minutes until the Yorkshire puddings are well risen and golden. Serve them as quickly as you can, while they are still tall and puffy.
