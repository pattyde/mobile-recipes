## How it's done

Cook rice in a rice cooker

Cut the pork fillet into 8 equal medallions and make a slice in the middle of each.

Cut the feta into 8 pieces and plug them into the incisions in the meat.

Sprinkle pork with a pinch of black pepper, wrap them in half a slice of prosciutto and flatten with your fist

Place oil and medallions, prosciutto side down, in the skillet and turn them regularly until they are golden brown and cooked through.

Meanwhile, slice the zucchini into thin slices and place them with 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan on the stove.

Add garlic, turn the heat to high and cook until aromatic

Chop the chilli and most of the bunch of mint finely, and put them in the pan turning heat to medium

Add salt and pepper to taste and stir frequently until they are soft.

Add the sage leaves to the pork for 30 seconds and fry until crispy.

Spoon the zucchini on a serving dish and place the pieces of meat and sage leaves on top.

Put the pan back on high heat, add a little water, the sun-dried tomatoes and the lemon juice, stir in the rice and warm this all for one minute.

Before serving spoon a few spoonfuls of yogurt on the rice, sprinkle a little balsamic vinegar over the meat and sprinkle on the rest of the mint leaves.
