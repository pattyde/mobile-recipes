## How it's done

### Ravioli

Heat olive oil in pan on medium heat, add spinach and cook until wilted and most of the liquid has evaporated

Chop cooked spinach finely and move to a bowl

Add parmesan and ricotta, and salt to taste. Mix well.

Place sheets of pasta dough on a floured surface. Cut approximately in half. If one 'half' ends up smaller, use that as the base for the ravioli.

Place balls of 2-3 teaspoons of spinach and ricotta mix onto base sheet of pasta at approx 15cm intervals along sheet.

Brush pasta around filling balls with water. Place second half sheet over the top and press around the filling to seal.

Cut into approx 7cm rounds with a cookie cutter.

Cook for 3 minutes in boiling water

### Sauce

Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add tomato and garlic to the pan. Cook covered for about 10 minutes until tomatoes soften.

Add white wine and thyme. Bring to boil and cook uncovered for 5 more minutes. Remove from heat.

Puree mix in blender

Transfer back to pan and add cream and tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes are heated through.

Serve over ravioli, sprinkle with thyme and parmesan
