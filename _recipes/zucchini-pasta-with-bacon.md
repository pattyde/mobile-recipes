## How it's done

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C.

Place cherry tomatoes on a baking paper in a roasting pan, drizzle with ½ tbsp olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 12-14 minutes until blistered and slightly charred.

Heat remaining olive oil in frying pan over medium heat. Cook bacon until crispy and remove from pan.

Cook garlic over medium heat until fragrant, then add mushrooms

Once mushrooms have cooked, add onion and chillis.

Add the wine to the pan to deglaze. Let this mixture simmer for about 5 minutes until alcohol cooks out of the wine.

Add the spiral cut zucchini to the pan and stir to coat in the wine sauce. Let this mixture cook for about 8-10 minutes, stirring every few minutes, until the zucchini is al dente.

Remove from heat and let cool slightly before adding in the egg yolk, egg and the parmesan. Toss in the roasted tomatoes and bacon, and top with more cheese.
