## How it's done

Boil eggplant in salted water for about 10 minutes, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until soft.

While eggplant boils, cook fine breadcrumbs under a grill for 5 minutes, stirring regularly (being careful not to burn them)

Drain eggplant, cool and press well to remove any excess liquid.

Finely chop eggplant and gently mix in a bowl with the moist breadcrumbs, pine nuts, parmesan, garlic, chillies, eggs and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.

Roll the mixture into 3 cm balls, then roll each ball in the dry breadcrumbs to coat evenly. If the mixture is too wet to roll easily, add more fresh breadcrumbs.

Pour oil into a wide frying pan to cover bottom of pan. Turn the heat to medium and when the oil begins to shimmer put a ball in. If it begins to sizzle immediately, the oil is ready. Fry the balls until browned all over. Drain on paper towels.

Cool for 10 minutes, then serve with tomato passata and fresh pasta
