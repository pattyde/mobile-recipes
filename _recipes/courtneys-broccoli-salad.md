## How it's done

Toast the sunflower seeds and almonds in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently until the seeds are turning golden on the sides.

Add the seeds, almonds, chopped broccoli, onion, cheese and cranberries to a serving bowl. Set aside.

Combine all of the dressing ingredients and whisk until the mixture is well blended.

Pour the dressing over the salad and stir until all of the broccoli is lightly coated in dressing. Let the salad marinate for at least 20 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator.
