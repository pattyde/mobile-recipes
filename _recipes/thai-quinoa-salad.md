## How it's done

Add quinoa, salt and 1 ½ cups boiling water to a medium saucepan.

Bring back to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is cooked.

Transfer to a serving bowl and let cool in the refrigerator.

Meanwhile, dice all vegetables and grate carrots

Make the dressing by combining the lime juice, fish sauce, vegetable oil and sugar in a medium bowl. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved.

Once the quinoa is cool, add the red bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, scallions, fresh herbs and dressing. Toss well, then taste and adjust seasoning with more salt, sugar and lime juice if necessary.
