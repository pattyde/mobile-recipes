## What you need

* 1.5 kg pork shoulder, skinless, without bone
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 onion, coarsely chopped
* 2 jalapeno, seeded and ribs removed, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 oranges, juice only

### The Rub

* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tbsp olive oil

<!-- break -->

## How it's done

Rinse and dry the pork shoulder, rub in salt and pepper.

Combine the rub ingredients then rub all over the pork.

Place the pork in a slow cooker (fat cap up), top with the onion, jalapeño, minced garlic (don't worry about spreading it) and squeeze over the juice of the orange.

Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours

The meat should be tender and falling off the bone. Remove from the slow cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred the pork using two forks.

Let cool until fat separates from juices remaining in slow cooker (overnight is easiest)

Skim off the fat from the juices remaining in the slow cooker and discard the fat. If you are left with a lot more than 1½ to 2 cups of juice, then reduce it (either in the slow cooker on the sauté setting with the lid off, or in a saucepan). Set aside.

Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large non stick pan over high heat. Place shredded pork into the pan and press down and cook until the bottom side is golden brown and crusty.

Pour over the juices and serve immediately

### To Freeze

After step 7, pour the juices and pork into airtight containers to store.

Freeze in small batches for convenience. To use, defrost completely and follow from step 7
