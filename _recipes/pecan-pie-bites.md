## How it's done

### Crust

Preheat oven to 180°C. Lightly spray a mini muffin pan with cooking spray and set aside.

Beat the butter and brown sugar until creamy. Add the flour and salt and beat until well combined.

Take a few tablespoons of dough and press into and up the sides of each mini muffin cup.

### Filling

In a large pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the chopped pecans and toast for about 10 minutes until golden brown, stirring frequently.

In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, light corn syrup, remaining 2 tablespoons of butter (melted), and vanilla.

Stir in the toasted pecans until well coated.

Spoon about a tablespoon of filling into each crust, filling it about ¾ full. Try not to overfill the crusts, as the filling will bubble over when they are baking.

Bake the bites for about 15 minutes or until the crusts just start to brown.

Remove from the oven and let set for about 5 minutes before scooping another tablespoon of filling onto each bite. Let bites cool in pan completely before removing.
