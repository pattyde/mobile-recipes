# What you need

* 2 tbsp oil
* 1 onion, finely diced
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 500g beef mince
* 2 tbsp plain flour
* 1/4 cup tomato sauce
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 1/4 cups beef stock
* 1 beef stock cube
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 sheets shortcrust pastry
* 2 sheets puff pastry
* 1 egg, whisked

# How it's done

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan then add the onion and garlic then cook stirring often until the onion is soft. Add the mince then increase the temperature to high and cook stirring with a wooden spoon making sure to break up the mince as much as possible so there are no lumps. This will take about 10 minutes.

Sprinkle the flour over the meat and cook for 1 minute, this should make the mixture appear dry and crumbly.

Add the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock and additional stock cube. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to medium and simmer stirring to prevent the meat from sticking to the base of the saucepan for 10 minutes until the sauce is thick. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Cut the shortcrust pastry to line the base and sides of the pie tin(s). Fill the pastry with the meat mixture being careful to avoid spilling any on the edges.

Cut the puff pastry to make the top for the pie tin(s). Brush the shortcrust pastry edges of the pies with water to moisten and top with the puff pastry. Press the pastry edges together to secure. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife then crimp the edges. Cut a small cross in the centre of each pie and brush the top with beaten egg.

Bake the pies in the preheated oven for 10 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 180 degrees C and bake for a further 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Serve the pies immediately.
