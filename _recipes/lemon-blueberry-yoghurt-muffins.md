## How it's done

Preheat the oven to 180°C.

Place 16 paper muffin cups in muffin pan and oil.

Sift together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together yoghurt, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, vanilla and oil.

Slowly whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. In the now empty dry ingredient bowl, mix the blueberries with the remaining tablespoon of flour, and fold them very gently into the batter.

Pour the batter into the pans and bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the muffin comes out clean.

Let cool on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.

Stir together the lemon juice and sugar and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.

Once dissolved, continue to cook for 3 more minutes.

Brush the top of the warm muffins with the lemon syrup. Let the syrup soak into the muffins and brush again.

Let the muffins cool completely.

Make the lemon glaze by whisking together the icing sugar and 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice. The mixture should be thick but pourable.

Pour the lemon glaze over the top of each muffin. Place a piece of lemon zest on each muffin.

Let the lemon glaze harden, about 15 minutes, before serving.
