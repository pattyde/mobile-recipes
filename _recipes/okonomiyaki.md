# How it's done

Start with 1/4 ( or less) of a smallish cabbage, cored and thinly sliced into a big mixing bowl. You can add and other veg at this point ( Green onion, sliced yellow onion, mushroom etc. and/or shrimp, ham , whatever.

Add 1/2 cup ( maybe a bit more depending on how much other stuff you added) of Okonomiyaki mix or just plain flour.

If you want, you can add about a tablespoon of dashi powder ( Aji-no-moto).

Add enough water to moisten the mix but you don’t want to to be very thin yet, it should be sort of pasty.

Once everything is well mixed crack an egg into it and mix it in. This should loosen it up a bit and give you a batter-like consistency. I like mine to be mostly cabbage with less batter but the ratio is up to you.

Dollop a large pancake sized portion into a hot pan. Cook them over medium- medium -high heat, I use sesame oil but canola is fine.

Lay strips of bacon over the top of the pancake as it cooks on the bottom. After 4-5 minutes it should be nicely browned on the bottom with crispy edges on the cabbage slices.

Flip carefully and cook on the other side till the bacon is done. flip again if the pancake seems likely to be under done in the middle ( depends on how thick they are. I sometimes add more oil during cooking. 

To serve you squirt okonomi sauce, kewpie Japanese mayo and sriracha sauce over the pancake, sprinkle with powered nori (Aonori, comes in small bottles or use a spice grinder on a sheet or 2 of nori and process to a powder).

Also top with katsuobushi (bonito flakes).

If I’m feeling undernourished I’ll also add a fried egg to the top.
