## How it's done

Cook orecchiette according to package instructions. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, add broccoli.

Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain and set aside

In a large pan, heat oil. Add sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.

Add 1 tablespoon butter and garlic and season with a generous amount of black pepper. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add about Â½ cup reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter then add broccoli rabe and pasta, tossing to combine.

Add Parmesan, lemon juice and zest, and red pepper flakes. Toss constantly until cheese is melty, removing skillet from heat when about half the cheese has melted. If sauce is too thick, loosen with more pasta water. Season with salt.
