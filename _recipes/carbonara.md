## How it's done

Chop guanciale into pieces and add to cold fry pan. Cook slowly. Once guanciale is cooked, set the pan on an angle so the fat drips to one edge of the pan and the meat stays crispy

Boil water for the pasta

Add egg yolk(s) to large stainless steel bowl. Whisk egg, parmesan, and pepper together using boiling pasta as a double boiler. Whisk some of the guanciale fat into the egg emulsion 

Cook pasta just short of being al dente. Add pasta to the emulsion and toss well to combine. Add pasta water if the mixture needs thinning
