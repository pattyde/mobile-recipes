## How it's done

Rinse potatoes in colander and dump into tea towel, roll into sausage shape and shake to dry the cubes

Place potatoes in large cast iron fry pan or similar. Add enough cooking oil to just cover or slightly less. Turn on heat to high and wait until potatoes have begun to fry well before you try to stir them to prevent sticking or breakage

Fry until golden brown and cooked well through

Remove from oil with slotted spoon. Remove oil from hot pan, leaving 1-2 tablespoons

Fry red onion until browned over med high heat

Add garlic and cook 10-20 seconds (donâ€™t let it burn)

Return potatoes to pan, season with onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt mix and then serve
