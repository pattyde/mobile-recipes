# How it's done

## Coconut Rice

Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain.

Combine the stock, coconut milk, and salt in a large heavy saucepan over medium-
high heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low. Add the rice and stir constantly for 1 minute. Cover the pan and simmer over low heat, without stirring, for 15 minutes or until the rice is almost tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.

Remove from the heat and stand covered for 10 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed. Lightly fluff up the rice with a fork. Transfer the rice to bowls and garnish with the toasted coconut and serve.

## Glaze

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Add the garlic, 1 tbsp of ginger, and chilli and stir over low heat for 2 minutes.

Add the orange juice and reduce by half. Add the soy sauce and honey and cook for 4–5 minutes, or until the glaze thickens slightly.

Add the coriander, lemon zest, and remaining tbsp of ginger and remove from the heat.

## Salmon

Heat the oil in a large non­stick frying pan over medium­ high heat. Remove the skin from the salmon. Season the salmon fillets with pepper.

Cook the salmon fillets for 1 minute or until just golden brown, then flip with a spatula and cook on the other side for 30 seconds. Remove the salmon to a foil lined oven tray. Preheat the grill.

Spoon a generous layer of the glaze over each salmon fillet and place under the grill for 2–3 minutes, or until the glaze is sticky and caramelised and the fish is cooked through, reserve remaining glaze.

Steam the bok choy until tender, about 3 minutes. Arrange 3 quarters of bok choy onto the centre of 4 serving plates. Place the salmon fillets over the top of the bok choy and spoon some of the remaining glaze over and around the salmon. Scatter over coriander and serve with the coconut rice.

**Try substituting bok choy with steamed broccoli.**
