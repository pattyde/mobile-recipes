# What you need
* 1.25kg eggplant (approx 3 eggplants)
* 9 cloves garlic
* 3 red chilli (1.5 if you want mild)
* 1 capsicum (any colour), seeded and halved
* Olive oil
* 0.5 cup ghee
* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 dried red chilli, broken
* 2 inch ginger, finely chopped
* 4 clove garlic (additional), finely chopped
* 2 red onion, finely chopped
* 1 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder (leave out if want mild)
* 2 tsp coriander powder
* 2 tsp tomato paste
* 2 tomato, finely chopped
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 4 tbsp coriander, finely chopped
* 1 cup frozen peas

# How it's done

Take eggplant and make 4 slits in each with a sharp knife, length ways and evenly spaced around each eggplant.

On each eggplant, stuff one clove of garlic in 3 slits, and one chilli in the last slit. Grease the eggplants with oil.

Start roasting eggplants on BBQ on low heat, turning 4 times. Takes approx 1 hour.

Add capsicum to BBQ 20 min before eggplant has finished cooking. Skin should char for easy peeling.

While eggplant cooks, heat ghee, cumin and dried chilli in a large fry pan until they pop.

Add ginger and garlic and cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly

Add onion and saute until it goes golden (approx 15 min)

Add chilli powder (is using), coriander powder and saute till spices turn aromatic.

Add tomato paste and stir until combined.

Add in tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft and mushy (approx 20 minutes, longer is fine).

When eggplant and capsicum are completely cool, start to peel the skin off.

Mash the eggplant and capsicum with a fork. Add to pan with salt.

Mix for 5 minutes or until flavours are well combined. Blend if desired

Add garam masala, 2 tbsp coriander and peas. Mix well. Enjoy with saffron rice, or roti
