Add fish and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours

To make the chipotle mayo, whisk together mayonnaise, greek yogurt, chipotle paste, lime juice and garlic.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add tilapia and cook, flipping once, about 2-3 minutes per side OR cook 2-3 min per side on a BBQ

Serve fish and other accompaniments on tortillas, drizzled with chipotle mayo

## Entree

Follow directions above, but serve in individual tortilla cups. To make:

* Heat tortillas in the microwave with wet paper towel for 1 minute
* Cut them into 6.5cm rounds, and press rounds into mini muffing pan
* Spray with oil, then bake for 8-10 minutes in a 180 degree oven.
* Stand for at least 5 minutes before removing from pan.

**Note: Don't pour the excess marinade over the fish. It makes it too limey**
