# How it's done

Mash chickpeas in a large bowl. Set aside.

Use a cheese cloth to squeeze out as much moisture as possible out of the zucchini and carrot

Add all ingredients except oil to the bowl with the mashed chickpeas.

Stir until completely combined.

Heat olive oil in a large pan on medium heat.

Scoop 2 tablespoons of mixture into your hand press to compress it into a patty. Cook for about 1-2 minutes, until the underside is golden brown then flip and repeat
