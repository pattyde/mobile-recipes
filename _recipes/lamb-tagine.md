## How it's done

Place lamb in a large bowl, toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil

In a large resealable bag, toss together the paprika, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, salt, ginger, saffron, garlic powder, and coriander; mix well

Add lamb to the bag, and shake to coat well. Refrigerate overnight.

Heat remaining oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat

Cook lamb, in batches, until well browned. Remove from pan

Add onions and carrots and cook for 5 minutes

Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant.

Return the lamb to the pan with the lemon zest, chicken stock, tomato paste and honey

Bring to the boil and then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender.

If the consistency of the tagine is too thin, you may thicken it with a mixture of corn flour and water during the last 5 minutes
