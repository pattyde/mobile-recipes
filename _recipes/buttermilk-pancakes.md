## How it's done

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous.

In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form.

In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous.

Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking.

Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined.

Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).

Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains.

Use a 1‚ÅÑ4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes.

Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer.
