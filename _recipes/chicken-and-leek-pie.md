Set aside to cool, then shred chicken and place in a large bowl. Reserve pan juices.

Melt butter in a pan and cook mushrooms for 5 minutes

## To Assemble

Line base of 4 pie tins with baking paper.

Cut shortcrust pastry into 4 circles about 2cm diametre wider than the rim of the pie tin. Place pie tin right way up on the centre of the circle of shortcrust pastry. Cut 3 slits from the edge of the pastry to the base of the pie tin.

Cut puff pastry into 4 circles the same size as the rim of the pie tins

Oil paper, then line with shortcrust pastry. Overlap shortcrust at slits to forms solid pie base- bind overlapping pastry together with egg if necessary

Drape puff pasty lid over the top and using egg as glue, pinch gently into shortcrust case to seal in the filling. Cut slits in the top of the puff pastry.
