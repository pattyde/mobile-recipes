## How it's done

Place chicken breast in a large pot with enough boiling water to cover completely. Simmer for 10 minute then turn off stove and leave chicken to cool in poaching water.

Remove chicken (reserving poaching liquid) and shred.

Blend dried shrimp, garlic, eschallots, ginger and chilli with a little water until a smooth paste forms.

Shell prawns. Add the oil and prawn shells to large saucepan or pot and fry 1-2 minutes until the shells turn red. Remove shells with a slotted spoon and discard.

Add the blended paste to the oil and fry for 1 minute before adding the laksa paste. Fry for 2-3 minutes until fragrant

Add the water used to poach chicken (+ extra required to reach 1.5L volume) and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the coconut cream and fish sauce and bring to a simmer.

Add the fish balls, tofu puffs and sugar. Season with fish sauce, salt, lime juice to taste. Reduce to simmer.

Bring another large saucepan of water to the boil. Blanch the rice noodles and egg noodles, separately, for 2 minutes then transfer to a colander and rinse with cold water.

Add prawns to laksa and poach for 2-3 mins

To serve, divide the noodles among bowls. Ladle over the broth and top with chicken, bean sprouts, spring onions, chilli, coriander, fried shallots and lime wedges.
