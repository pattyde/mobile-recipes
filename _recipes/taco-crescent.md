## How it's done

Preheat oven to 200 degrees (180 fan forced).

Roll out dinner roll dough into a large circle about 25cm diameter for large pieces, two 13cm circles for small finger food sized pieces

Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut circle/s into pizza-like wedges (12 wedges).

Any extra dough may be used to make 4 or so dinner rolls!

On a corn-floured pizza stone, arrange wedges in a ring with the wide ends toward the center of the baking stone & slightly overlapping each other and the points of the triangles pointing out.

Press the wide ends of dough together & slightly in toward the middle of the ring to create a wide, solid base for the filling.

Lay a sheet of foil or large tea towel over the dough for 30-45 min to let rise

Brown beef in large skillet. Drain.

Add taco seasoning and vegetables to meat. Cook until vegetables just begin to soften

Add refried beans and water to meat. Stir til combined and reduce.

Spoon hot mixture over the wide ends of the dough in a ring. Stuff in as much filling as possible

Top with spices and grated cheese

Bring the pointed ends of the wedges up & over the filling & tuck under the wide ends to encase the filling. You will have some filling peeking out between wedges.

Brush dough with beaten egg

Bake uncovered for 15 minutes

Serve topped with any or all suggested toppings.
