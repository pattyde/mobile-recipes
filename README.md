# üçî Our recipes

## To add a new recipe:

1 - Clone the repo and pull in the latest changes.

2 - Create new markdown file in the `_recipes` folder (see below)

* The front matter in the markdown file should contain the recipe name and any tags for the recipe.
* Tags should be single words, or joined with a dash
* Between the ingredients and method, ensure you insert `<!-- break -->`. This breaks the content into two columns

```

tags: individual tags separated by spaces join-with-dashes

## What you need

* An ingredient
